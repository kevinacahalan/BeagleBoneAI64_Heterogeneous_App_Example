![demo_image](R5_LINUX.png)

For this example to work, use beagle firmware with kernel 6.12. Make to to have the latest device tree overlay setup for 6.12.

This example was built off of Fred Eckert's example: https://github.com/FredEckert/bbai64_cortex-r5_example/tree/r5_toggle

Example shows:
1. How to initialize a remoteproc resource table with a working trace log.
2. How to setup boot code to enable the FPU
3. How to initialize the MPU and cache to run code from DDR memory.
3. How to setup handlers to deal with interrupts
4. EPWM flashing LED on pin P9_25 for  seconds
5. Rpmsg talking...Linux calling simple math functions in R5




#### Setup board
1. Grab debian 6.12 firmware. Flash the emmc, and also an sd card.
2. Flash emmc with https://www.beagleboard.org/distros/bbai64-debian-12-9-2025-03-05-minimal-flasher-v6-12-x-ti
3. Flash SD card with https://www.beagleboard.org/distros/bbai64-debian-12-9-2025-03-05-minimal-v6-12-x-ti
4. Power cycle board several times
5. Run `df -h` to ensure you are now booting from your SD card
6. Run this to get latest DT source among other important things `sudo apt update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y`
7. Add the overlay k3-j721e-beagleboneai64-pwm-epwm4-p9_25.dtbo to extlinux.conf
8. Power cycle the boars several times
9. Verify overlay is loaded `sudo beagle-version | grep UBOOT`
10. Check and make sure P9_25 is muxed to ehrpwm4_b `sudo ./scripts/show-pins.pl`



#### Setup and compile ti RTOS SDK
Make sure to use **Debian12** for building. It will make your life easier. On windows use WSL Debian 12.

1.  Run `wget https://dr-download.ti.com/software-development/software-development-kit-sdk/MD-bA0wfI4X2g/10.00.00.05/ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j721e-evm-10_00_00_05.tar.gz`
2.  Use `tar -xzf ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j721e-evm-10_00_00_05.tar.gz` to decompress
3.  Place decompressed sdk folder in ~/ti/
4.  Run `sudo apt install libtinfo5`  needed for ti sdk build

##### Build sdk/pdk:
1. Change to the directory `~/ti/ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j721e-evm-10_00_00_05/pdk_jacinto_10_00_00_27/packages` using `cd`.
2. 
    From the `packages` directory within the Jacinto PDK, run `make -s all_libs BUILD_PROFILE=release` to build the release libraries, and run `make -s all_libs BUILD_PROFILE=debug` to build the debug libraries.

    OPTIONAL:
    If you want to build the TI examples you may have to direct TI to also use the system compiler for some reason... You will also need to install the `mono-complete` package.

    For gcc arm to work install `arm-none-eabi-gcc`. Next setup the environment variables that TI uses to find the compiler. 
    - `export TOOLCHAIN_PATH_GCC=/usr`
    - `export TOOLCHAIN_PATH_GCC_ARCH64=/usr`
    - `export GCC_ARCH64_BIN_PREFIX=arm-none-eabi`

    Run `make all_examples CORE=mcu2_0` to compile examples. NOTE that `make all_examples` does not actually compile all examples, it only compiles the examples for mcu1_0. Some examples do not work with mcu1_0.

3.  The library release .a files are located at `~/ti/ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j721e-evm-10_00_00_05/pdk_jacinto_10_00_00_27/packages/ti/[LIBRARY]/lib/j721e/r5f/release`, and the debug files are at `~/ti/ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j721e-evm-10_00_00_05/pdk_jacinto_10_00_00_27/packages/ti/[LIBRARY]/lib/j721e/r5f/release/debug`.
    
    These ".a" files have an unusual extension, ".aer5f".


#### To build R5 code:
- Build TI sdk and place it at correct location as directed above.
- install `gcc-arm-none-eabi`
- Run `make` from folder with R5 makefile

#### To build Linux code:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
sudo dpkg --add-architecture arm64
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgpiod-dev:arm64

make CROSSCOMPILE=true # default is to not cross compile
```

#### To build everything at once:
`[SCRIPT_DIR]/build_script.sh --beaglebone`

#### To build and copy to board:
`[SCRIPT_DIR]/compile_and_push.sh --ip [BEAGLE_IP]`

#### To run
`sudo [SCRIPT_DIR]/debug_run.sh`

### Device tree info
- Add your overlays to `blablabla/extlinux/extlinux.conf`
- Overlay source is located at `/opt/source/something/something`
- To compile source run `sudo make clean` and `sudo make` from `bla bla bla`
- To install changes run `sudo make arm64_install` from `bla bla bla`. Make sure to reference your overlays in `extlinux.conf`
- Connect to debug uart and have fun. You'll be down for some trial and error. You may end up re-flashing your board several times to recover it...

There will be better instructions written here in the future

- You could make use of https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SYSCONFIG to figure out pin muxing.
- v6.12.x-Beagle/src/arm64/ti/k3-j721e-main.dtsi is a very important file. If you want to use
some IO device that is not defined in here, you will have to dig into the TDA4VM TRM and write your equivalent fanciness in your overlay. Defining power-domains, clocks, so on. For example for eqep... (vague understanding of things that could be wrong...)
